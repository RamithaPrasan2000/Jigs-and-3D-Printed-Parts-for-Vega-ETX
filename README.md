# Jigs and 3D Printed Parts for Vega ETX

I designed four jigs to weld defected sheet metal parts stamped by a hydraulic stamping machine. To solve this issue, the parts should be cut according to measurements. To overcome this problem, I designed 3D-printed parts to measure and mark the defected area. Then, the jigs were made to weld those parts in the production line.
